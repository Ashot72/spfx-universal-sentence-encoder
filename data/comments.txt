They have almost everything
It is worth much money
It is not worth much money
Amazon generally has most things I want
I have been irritated at the slow deliveries from Amazon
Amazon has much variety and can find almost anything one might want
Amazon should spend more time training their delivery drivers.
Amazon can no longer be trusted
Great choices, great selection, great prices in most cases
Amazon is not the same company
There is good and bad with Amazon
Amazon is my go-to
There really is no guarantee on next day delivery
I am so sorry that Amazon has come to this
Amazon always had tremendous value and selection
You can literally find things that you were not even looking for
Keep their word on delivery commitments
